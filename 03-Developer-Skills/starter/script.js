/* Coding Challenge #1
Given an array of forecasted maximum temperatures, the thermometer displays a
string with the given temperatures. Example: [17, 21, 23] will print "... 17ºC in 1
days ... 21ºC in 2 days ... 23ºC in 3 days ..."
Your tasks:
1. Create a function 'printForecast' which takes in an array 'arr' and logs a
string like the above to the console. Try it with both test datasets.
2. Use the problem-solving framework: Understand the problem and break it up
into sub-problems!
Test data:
§ Data 1: [17, 21, 23]
§ Data 2: [12, 5, -5, 0, 4]
GOOD LUCK  */

//Undersatnding the problem
//1. There is an array with values.
//2. Need to Display data within a string.

//Breaking-up the problem
//1. creating a function named printForecast with arr as array prarameter
//2. console.log the values and the string using template literal
//3. remember to use let for changing values

const printForecast = function (arr) {
  let j = 1;
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    console.log(`... ${arr[i]}ºC in ${j} days`);
    j++;
  }
};

printForecast([17, 21, 23]);
